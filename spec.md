# Single Calendar App Integration in Odoo

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the software requirements for integrating various calendar views in Odoo into a single calendar app. The objective of this integration is to provide a unified view of important dates from different modules, allowing users to manage and monitor activities more efficiently.

## 2. Scope

The initial integration will include the following dates:

- Sales meetings
- Warehouse scheduled dates
- Helpdesk support dates
- Project and task dates

The design should allow for the possibility to expand the scope of dates to include additional modules in the future.

## 3. Calendar View

### 3.1 Default View

- The default view for the integrated calendar app will be the month view.
- changes made to an event on the Calender App are reflected on respective module/model (ex. Warehouse scheduled dates).

### 3.2 Optional Views

In addition to the default month view, the integrated calendar app will also support:

- Week view
- Day view

The right-side month-view present in the standard Odoo calendar module is not necessary in the integrated calendar app.

## 4. Calendar Items

### 4.1 Display Information

Each calendar item will display the following information:

- Source-document number
- Partner name
- Execution times

### 4.2 Color Coding

Calendar items should be color-coded based on their originating module (e.g., sales meetings, warehouse scheduled dates, etc.) to provide a clear visual distinction between different types of events.

## 5. Expandability

The integrated calendar app should be designed with the ability to expand its scope to include additional dates from other modules in the future. This should be achieved with minimal effort and should not require significant changes to the existing structure.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

### 6.1 Performance

The integrated calendar app should maintain high performance levels, ensuring that loading times and user interactions remain quick and responsive.

### 6.2 Compatibility

The integrated calendar app should be compatible with the latest version of Odoo and follow best practices for Odoo module development.

### 6.3 Usability

The integrated calendar app should be user-friendly, easy to navigate, and visually appealing, adhering to Odoo's design guidelines.

## 7. Conclusion

This software requirements specification provides the necessary details for the development and integration of a single calendar app in Odoo. By following this specification, developers can create a unified view of essential dates from various modules, allowing for improved organization and management of activities across different business areas.
